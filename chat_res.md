Document(page_content='8 â”‚ MEASURING FINANCIAL LITERACY  \n \nLEVELS OF FINANCIAL LITERACY IN CIS COUN TRIES \n  2.  Measuring f inancial literacy  \n2.1. This report  \nThis report builds on previous OECD measurement work including a recent report \nexploring the financial knowledge, attitude s and behaviour, plus financial inclusion, in \nG20 countries and the two guest countries - the Netherlands and Norway (OECD, \n2017[2]).  \nFinancial literacy is a complex phenomenon and so the sections that follow aim to di scuss \nvarious different factors  as independent components and combined into meaningful \nscores to facilitate comparison and make it possible to identify specific similarities and \ndifferences.  \nThe report contains descrip tive text, tables and figures, as follows :  \n\uf0b7 Section 3 reports levels of f inancial knowledg e. \n\uf0b7 Section 4 discusses financial behaviours . \n\uf0b7 Section 5  focuses on a ttitudes to longer -term financial planning.  \n\uf0b7 Section 6 reports an overall score for finan cial literacy for each country . \n\uf0b7 Section 7 focuses on particular target groups.  \n\uf0b7 Section 8 provides analysis on aspects of financial inclusion .  \n\uf0b7 Section 9 highlights the most striking findings by country.  \nThe Russian Federation is  represented in the  majority of  figures and tables in this report ; \nhowever, the tailored version of the Toolkit used  for this dedicated data collection \nexercise included a few questions that were not asked in the Russian Federation, and so \ncertain figures only refer to the six CIS countries . The reported mean is a country level \nmean across countries with available data.  \nWhere relevant, G20 averages are also discussed in the text.  These averages  refer to the \naverage across only those G20 c ountries that have submitted  comparable data. The \nnumber of G20 countries included in each of these calculations therefore depends on the \navailability of data.', metadata={'source': './knowledge_base/financial-literacy-cis-countries-survey-EN.pdf', 'page': 8})
